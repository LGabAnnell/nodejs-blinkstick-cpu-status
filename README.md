# nodejs-blinkstick-cpu-status

Code to show your cpu load through a blinkstick, from green (low) to yellow (medium) to red (heavy).

Works with the blinkstick square or the blinkstick stick (8 leds)

Relies on https://github.com/LGabAnnell/expose-cpu-info.

Can run on any computer within your LAN / WLAN (I have the blinkstick connected to my Pi4)
